# Uncommon Error Handling in Python: Unexpected Input Types

This repository demonstrates a Python function that handles common exceptions (ZeroDivisionError and TypeError) during division. However, it also highlights a less common scenario: how the function might behave with unexpected input types.  The `bug.py` file shows the function and its potential for unusual behavior, and the solution (`bugSolution.py`) demonstrates a more robust and flexible approach.

## How to run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `python bug.py` to see the original code's behavior.
4. Run `python bugSolution.py` to observe the improved error handling.
